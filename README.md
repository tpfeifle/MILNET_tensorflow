### Topic

Comparing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Classification of Discourse Units and Sentences



### Description

Split up sentences of the provided Amazon dataset by using RST parsers (one is provided as example, but make an own investigation, too).

Perform and compare sentiment analysis classification of reviews. Comparison is done between sequences of discourse units (DUs) on the one hand and sequences of sentences on the other hand.

Use XLING as sentence-wise or DU-wise features.

Perform multi-instance learning, as done in the provided paper [1].

Extract DUs on a not yet annotated part of the Non-annotated Organic Dataset and provide it as annotation task to the whole course :->. Run your experiments again on the collected data.
